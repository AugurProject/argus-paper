\title{Argus: Deciding Questions about Events \\ (working paper)}
\author{Petr Baudi≈° \\ Ailao}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}%
	We consider the problem of reliably answering yes/no questions
	about events based on news sources in settings of the Argus QA
	system and the Syphon question pre-validator.
	We give a brief overview of the relevant state-of-art methods
	in the academic field of Natural Language Processing,
	requirements for building a solid state-of-art system
	and difficulties we may anticipate in the road ahead.
	Based on this, we propose a basic architecture of the Argus
	system, roadmap to achieve baseline performance, and a basic
	version of the Syphon system.
\end{abstract}

In the working paper you should be sure to highlight the key aspects of uncertainty and anticipated difficulty.
	
And also, of course, the need for +alpha development - to whatever extent you
can detail what specifically is known and unknown that future development would
help clarify. Bringing in +that recent Cornell research might also be helpful
if you consider it valid (I know you were kind of skeptical of it).

Another thing I neglected to mention - I know they're not exactly the same, but it would also be very good to whatever extent you can to
point to YodaQA as a kind of preliminary proof of concept and include any mention you can of the lessons learned from building that and how those
lessons would/might come in to play with building the "yes/no/unclear" Argus option.
